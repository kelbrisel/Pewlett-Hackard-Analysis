# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Purpose:
To create a database of employees for Pewlett-Hackard, a list of employees retiring, and a list of employees eligible for the mentorship program to backfill those positions and aid in succession planning

## Results: 
* Out of 300k employees, 90,398 are approaching retirement. 
* The largest group of future retirees is 'Senior Engineer' at 29.4k employees, with 'Senior Staff' at a close second with 28.2k employees. Combined, they account for 2/3rds of all employees approaching retirement.
* Only 1,549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program, as it stands. 
* There were 43.3 promotions or title changes within the retiring group of 90.3k employees (47%)
* Out of the 1.5k mentorship-program-eligible employees, only 10% hold title 'Senior Engineer', compared to 32% of retirement-eligible employees.

## Summary: 
Pewlett-Hackard will potentially need to fill over ninety-thousand positions (depending on vitality of each role and any projected changes in company structure or hierarchy). 
It does not appear that Pewlett-Hackard has the staff numbers necessary to fill the vacant positions. With only 1.5k (out of 300k employees) eligible for the mentorship program, each would need to mentor up to 58 employees.

## Recommendations
In order to support succession planning, retirement dates by month or quarter could be compiled with a new database to give HR a more clear timeline. 
The range of salaries by title (for the group approaching retirement) would be another table to offer insight into potential cost savings for the company should they chose to promote existing staff into those roles, or hire externally.
